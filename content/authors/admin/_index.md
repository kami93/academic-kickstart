I am a researcher at the **[Research Institute of Hanyang University](https://www.hanyang.ac.kr/web/eng/research-institute)** where I am working on developing context-aware motion forecasting technologies. Specifically, I focus on machine learning models that enable robots (and vehicles) to comprehend multimodal contexts (e.g., vision, policy, and language) and predict surrounding agents' intentions and actions. To realize them, I develop and use novel deep neural network architectures, generative models, and policy-learning algorithms.
