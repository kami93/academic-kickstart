I focus on multimodal representation learning. In particular, much interest of mine is now on capturing complementary interactions between texts and vision, and a model's sense of uncertainty under quantitative and qualitative variations in the multimodal information. I am pursing my Ph.D. degree at Algorithmic Intelligence Laboratory - KAIST, advised by Dr. Jinwoo Shin (My official terms of study is starting from September 2021). Previously, I graduated from Hanyang University with M.S. and B.S degrees under Dr. Jun-Won Choi, where I studied machine learning models for motion forecasting. Please find my CV for more details!
