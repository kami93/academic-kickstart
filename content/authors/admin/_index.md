I am a researcher at the **[Hanyang Research Institute of Industrial Science](http://riis.hanyang.ac.kr/)**, where I research context-aware motion forecasting technologies. Specifically, I am focusing on machine learning models that enable robots (and vehicles) to comprehend multimodal context (e.g., vision, policy, and language) in the environment and predict the intentions and actions of surrounding agents. Previously, I earned my Master's degree from Hanyang University where I developed novel neural network architectures for trajectory prediction that are published at major conferences.

I am currently looking for a laboratory/school to pursue a degree in machine learning theory to understand, quantify, and deal with uncertainty in the real world's data. If you are interested in advising me at your group, please contact me through **[shpark@spa.hanyang.ac.kr](mailto://shpark@spa.hanyang.ac.kr)**.
