I am a researcher at the **[Research Institute of Industrial Science](http://riis.hanyang.ac.kr)**, Hanyang University, where I develop context-aware motion forecasting technologies. Specifically, I am focusing on machine learning models that enable robots (and vehicles) to comprehend multimodal context (e.g., vision, policy, and language) in the environment and predict the actions of surrounding agents. Previously, I earned my Master's degree from Hanyang University with studies on deep learning models for trajectory prediction.

I am currently seeking a position at research laboratories/schools to study (and possibly pursue a degree in) machine learning theory to understand, quantify, and deal with uncertainty in the real world agents' motions and interactions. If you are interested in advising me at your group, please contact me through **[shpark@spa.hanyang.ac.kr](mailto://shpark@spa.hanyang.ac.kr)**.
